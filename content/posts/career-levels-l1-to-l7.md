Many organisations categorise job roles by levels, starting from level 1 (L1) for junior positions and progressing up to level 7 (L7) or higher for senior positions.

This post serves as a subjective guideline for interpreting how these levels apply.

- L1: Entry-level.

    Require supervision to deliver work.

    Example: A back-end engineer working on a user microservice, receiving guidance from other team members.

- L2: Junior.

    Deliver work independently without supervision.

    Example: A back-end engineer autonomously building features and resolving issues on the user microservice.

- L3: Senior.

    Recognise and comprehend the interconnections between their work and other closely related components.

    Example: A back-end engineer working on the user microservice, understanding its relationship with the purchase and product microservices.

- L4: Lead.

    Have an understanding that extends horizontally across other interrelated teams in the company.

    Example: A back-end engineer who understands how the user, purchase, and product microservices interweave with product onboarding and user journey tracking.

- L5: Staff, or L5M: Director.

    Able to interconnect the relationships between multiple departments within an organisation.

    Example: Storing user personally identifiable information (PII) may require user consent and internal legal reviews. Additionally, they understand how user journey performance translates to accounting figures.

- L6: Senior Staff, or L6M: Head or Vice President.

    Transform strategic vision into departmental plans.

- L7: Principal, or L7M: Executive.

    Possess the strategic vision to bring products and services to market for business profitability.

As the job level increases, the role becomes more multifaceted and involves a greater variety of tasks, in contrast to entry-level positions that are more task-specific.

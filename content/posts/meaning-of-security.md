Security
- se = without
- cura = care
- absence of concern
- now, sollicitus, restless from fear, anxiety, alarm
- industry defined by FUD
- inflicts pain on others (development, product, engineer) and itself
- obsession with vulnerability but not elimination of them

In the eyes of security practitioners, users are weak sheep that must be told what to do.

Securitas
- a group of emotions relating to absence of fear and include emotions like trust and confidence
- current security practices don't seem to produce securitas

Why companies are not prioritising security?
- But then, what allows the company to pay security practitioners in the first place?

Purpose of security is to promote the welfare of something, and promoting welfare is not just about stopping threats.

Security vs insecurity
- Security, goal-oriented
- Insecurity, threat-oriented, everything is a threat (api, ci/cd, laptop, etc)

Objective security measures the absence of threats to acquired values.

Security practitioners sacrifice everyone's time, energy, and money to FUD god altar to gain more budget, headcount, and influence.

Security practitioners should reduce the complexity of security problems.
